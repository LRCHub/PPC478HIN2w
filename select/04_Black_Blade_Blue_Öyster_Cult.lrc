[00:14.58] I have this feeling that my luck is none too good
[00:20.35] This sword here at my side don't act the way it should
[00:25.81] Keeps calling me its master, but I feel like its slave
[00:31.17] Hauling me faster and faster to an early, early grave
[00:37.32] And it howls! It howls like hell!
[00:53.82] 
[00:44.52] I'm told it's my duty to fight against the law
[00:49.44] That wizardry's my trade and I was born to wade through gore
[00:55.36] I just want to be a lover, not a red-eyed screaming ghoul
[01:01.47] I wish it'd picked another to be its killing tool
[01:25.97] 
[01:07.09] Black Blade, Black Blade
[01:14.08] Forged a billion years ago
[01:16.12] Black Blade, Black Blade
[01:22.02] Killing so its power can grow
[01:36.52] 
[02:55.68] It's death from the beginning to the end of time
[03:52.08] And I'm the cosmic champion and I hold a mystic sign
[03:58.30] And the whole world's dying and the burden's mine
[04:04.40] And the black sword keeps on killing 'til the end of time
[04:32.90] 
[04:10.56] Black Blade, Black Blade
[04:17.73] Bringing chaos to the world we know
[04:20.76] Black Blade, Black Blade
[04:26.72] And it's using me to kill my friends
[04:29.56] Black Blade, Black Blade
[04:35.36] Getting stronger so the world will end
[04:39.18] Black Blade, Black Blade
[04:44.47] Forcing my mind to bend and bend
[05:00.47] 
[05:13.56] I am the Black Blade
[05:18.17] Forged a million billion years ago
[05:27.16] My cosmic soul it goes on for eternity
[05:39.22] Carving out destiny
[05:41.31] Bringing in the Lords of Chaos
[05:45.95] Bringing up the Beasts of Hades
[05:49.24] Sucking out the souls of heroes
[05:52.48] Laying waste to knights and ladies
[05:56.15] My master is my slave
[06:03.19] Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!
[06:08.72] You poor fucking humans
