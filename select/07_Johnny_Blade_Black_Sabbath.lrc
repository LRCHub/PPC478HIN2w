[00:53.66] Tortured and twisted, he walks the streets alone
[00:59.54] People avoid him, they know the street's his own
[01:05.86] Cold blade of silver, his eyes they burn so wild
[01:12.31] Mean as a tiger, society's own child
[01:30.31] 
[01:18.96] Those who try to burn him pay
[01:21.98] You don't do that to Johnny Blade
[01:25.46] He's the meanest guy around his town
[01:28.45] One look and he will cut you down
[01:30.83] Johnny Blade, Johnny Blade
[01:43.83] 
[01:36.94] Life has no meaning, and Death's his only friend
[01:42.90] Will fate surprise him, where will he meet his end?
[01:49.78] He feels so bitter, yes he's so full of hate
[01:55.84] To die in the gutter, I guess that's Johnny's fate
[02:20.84] 
[02:02.19] Rivals all across the land
[02:05.73] He kills them with his knife in hand
[02:09.08] He's the meanest guy around his town
[02:12.11] One look and he will cut you down
[02:14.26] Johnny Blade, Johnny Blade
[02:20.65] Johnny Blade, Johnny Blade
[02:33.65] 
[02:46.36] Well you know that Johnny's a spider
[02:52.62] And his web is the city at night
[03:00.05] He's a victim of modern frustration
[03:05.83] That's the reason he's so ready to fight
[03:25.83] 
[03:14.02] He's the one that should be afraid
[03:19.94] What will happen to you, Johnny Blade?
[03:38.94] 
[03:38.90] Oh he knows his future's decided
[03:45.70] And he ain't gonna change it, no way
[03:52.41] He was born to die in the gutter
[03:58.92] He'll keep fighting 'till the end of his days
[04:21.42] 
[04:06.03] Been alone all through his life
[04:12.49] His only friend is a switchblade knife
[04:19.08] He's the one who should be afraid
[04:25.68] What will happen to you, Johnny Blade?
[04:44.68] 
[04:35.45] You fool the people
[04:42.20] Who's fooling who?
[04:47.83] It's time to listen
[04:53.94] Who's fool are you?
